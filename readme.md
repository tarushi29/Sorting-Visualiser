Sorting  Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This web application is designed to provide an interactive and visual representation of various sorting algorithms. Users can observe the step-by-step process of sorting and gain insights into the time complexities of each algorithm. The implemented algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

Features
Algorithm Visualization
Watch the sorting algorithms in action through a visually appealing and informative display. Each step of the sorting process is represented graphically, allowing users to better understand how different algorithms work.

Time Complexities
Gain insights into the time complexities of each sorting algorithm. The application provides clear and concise information about the time complexity of each algorithm, helping users understand their efficiency in different scenarios.

Total Run Time
View the total run time of each algorithm for a given input size. This feature allows users to compare the real-world performance of algorithms based on the execution time on specific datasets.

Implemented Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort:

A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Insertion Sort:

Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking elements from the input data and inserting them into their correct position.
Selection Sort:

Sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.
Merge Sort:

Divides the unsorted list into n sub-lists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sub-lists to produce new sorted sub-lists until there is only one sub-list remaining.
Quick Sort:

Uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to divide the array into two partitions and then recursively sorts the partitions.
